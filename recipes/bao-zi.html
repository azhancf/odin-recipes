            <h2 class="section">Steps</h2>
                <h3 class="parts">Dough</h3>
                    <ol class="text">
                        <li>Mix flour, yeast, and sugar in a large mixing bowl until combined. While mixing, slowly pour in water until it is absorbed and forms a shaggy dough.</li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Stand Mixer: </strong>using a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, knead on low speed for 5-8 minutes until dough comes together.</p>
                            <p><strong>By Hand: </strong>knead with your hands either in the bowl or on a lightly floured surface for 10-15 minutes.</p>
                            <p>The dough should be soft and smooth.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>Cover the bowl with a damp towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size. It will take between 40 minutes and 1.5 hours depending on the room temperature.</li>
                    </ol>
                <h3 class="parts">Pork Filling</h3>
                    <ol class="text">
                        <li>Combine pork, soy and oyster sauces, five-spice powder, salt, ground white pepper, and cooking oil in a bowl. Mix, stirring in one direction, until well combined. Gradually add in water one tablespoon at a time until no more liquid is visible.</li>
                        <li>Right before assembly, add in napa cabbage, scallion, and cilantro. Mix until uniformly combined. The filling should be a sticky and cohesive mass.</li>
                    </ol>
                <h3 class="parts">Assembly</h3>
                    <ol class="text">
                        <li>Knead the dough until it deflates and returns to its original size. Divide dough into 30 equal portions â€“ dividing by halves each time to ensure uniformity. Roll each piece into a disk-like wrapper approximately 3-4 inches in diameter. Place approximately 1 tablespoon of filling in the middle of a wrapper then fold into a bao shape. Leave all the assembled buns to rest for another 15 minutes or so. This ensures that they will not deflate after steaming.</li>
                    </ol>
                <h3 class="parts">Steaming</h3>
                    <ol class="text">
                        <li>Line a steamer basket with parchment paper. Place buns at least 1 inch away from each other and the edge of the steamer. Start with cold water over high heat. When the water boils, steam for 15-18 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Your baozi is nice and hot! You can freeze cooked buns. To serve, defrost in the fridge then steam for 8 minutes, or steam for 15 minutes without defrosting.</li>
