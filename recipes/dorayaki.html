        <h2 class="section">Description</h2>
            <p class="text"><em>Dorayaki</em> is a popular Japanese confectionary consisting of sweet red bean paste sandwiched between sweet pancakes.</p>
            <p class="text">Legend has it that the first Dorayaki were made when a samurai named Benkei forgot his gong (dora) upon leaving a farmerâ€™s home where he was hiding, and the farmer subsequently used the gong to fry the pancakes.</p>
        <h2 class="section">Ingredients</h2>
            <ul class="text">
                <li>5/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
                <li>2 eggs</li>
                <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
                <li>1 tbsp honey</li>
                <li>3/4 cup milk</li>
                <li>Anko <em>(sweet red bean paste)</em></li>
            </ul>
        <h2 class="section">Steps</h2>
            <ol class="text">
                <li>Mix flour and baking soda in a bowl.</li>
                <li>In another bowl, whisk eggs, sugar, and honey together. Add milk and mix well.</li>
                <li>Stir dry ingredients into egg mixture, and whisk until batter becomes smooth.</li>
                <li>Heat non-stick frying pan with a small amount of oil and wipe excess oil well. At medium low heat, drop 1/8 of a cup of batter onto the pan, like a pancake. Cook about 2 minutes until the surface of the pancake has a lot of bubbles and the edges become dry. Flip over and cook 1 more minute.</li>
                <li>Transfer to a plate and cover with a wet paper towel.</li>
                <li>Take one cake and place a heaping tablespoon of Anko and cover with another cake. Wrap it with plastic and press with hands. Pinch to seal the edges of the pancakes together.</li>
